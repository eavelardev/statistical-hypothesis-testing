# statistical-hypothesis-testing
Implement statistical hypothesis tests with Python

I implemented the hypothesis testing examples from the book Elementary Statistics_ Picturing the World 6e - Ron Larson.

My purpose is to compare the execution time of two different algorithms to know if there is enough evidence at a certain level of significance to support that one algorithm is better than the other in execution time.
